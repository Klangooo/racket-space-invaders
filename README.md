Space Invaders in Racket
============

This space invaders game was finished in two passes as assignments of the [Intensive Foundations of Computer Science](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/skotthe/classes/cs5001/Fall/2016/index.html) Course. 

It was firstly assigned after we were introduced to lists in Racket. And the program was refactored considerably and extended further by intensively using higher-order functions.

The specifications (assignment instructions) can be found 

1. [Here](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/skotthe/classes/cs5001/Fall/2016/module4.html) in the **Assignment 6** tag, and
2. [Here](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/skotthe/classes/cs5001/Fall/2016/module5.html) in the **Assignment 8** tag

or, you may go to the **[specifications](https://github.com/jeremylinlin/racket-space-invaders/tree/master/specifications)** directory and see the screenshots

## To start the program:
 - either start the program from your terminal `$ racket space-invader.rkt`
